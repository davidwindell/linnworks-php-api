# Linnworks PHP API starter code

Linnworks is a multichannel order processing system (www.linnworks.com).

Here's some code to get started using the Linnworks SOAP API from PHP.

NOTE: Only a subset of API calls are included in this code. Feel free to extend the code as you see fit.

## Getting started

### Step 1: generate a linnworks API key

Log into your linnworks account via http://acc.linnworks.com.  Under your 'My Account' section you'll see a link to a page that allows you to generate keys.  You can generate either a simple or secure key - either can be used.

### Step 2: write some code

#### Creating a product in Linnworks:

<?php

require_once('lib/Linnworks/Api.php')

$api = \Linnworks\InventoryApi('YOUR-API-KEY');

// see: http://api.linnlive.com/inventory.asmx?op=SaveStockItem

$item = array('SKU'=>"test-sku',
              'ItemTitle'=>'test product',
              'IsSetItemTitle'=>true,
              'isSetRetailPrice'=>true,
              'RetailPrice'=>100,
              'BarcodeNumber'=>'12345678',
              'IsSetBarcodeNumber'=>true);

$itemId = $api->saveStockItem($item);

?>

Unfortunately the linnworks documentation is incredibly sparse and they only provide sample API code in C#. This is next to useless for PHP developers as the C# code was largely auto generated by Visual Studio.

Whilst this code is provided as is, and is by no means a completed project, hopefully it will speed up the development process for anyone needing to do bespoke integration with linnworks via PHP.
